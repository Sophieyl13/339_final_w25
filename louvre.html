            <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre -->
            <p>The Louvre/Louvre Museum is on the right bank of the Seine. It's one of the most famous museums in the world, originally a defensive castle and converted into the primary of residence of the kings of France. First opening as a museum in 1793, the exhibition grew from 537 paintings to not approximately 500,000 objects. </p>

            <p>The Louvre was the first museum I visited during my trip. It was amazing from the objects to the architecture of the museum itself. I spent around a total of 8 hours at the museum that day, and every hour was worth it!</p>

            <h2>My Favorites</h2>
            <p>Of course, it is not surprising that I didn't get to all the pieces in the Louvre, so here are my favorites of what I saw!</p>
        <!-- </div> -->
        <div class = "faves" id = "first">
            <h3>#1: Winged Victory of Samothrace, 2nd century BCE</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvreone.JPG" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Surprisingly, this was my favorite. I definitely think seeing the paintings up close in real life changed my perception of them. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "second">
            <h3>#2: Théodore Géricault, The Raft of the Medusa, 1818-1819</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvretwo.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Similar to the first painting, seeing this painting up close made me admire it more. The painting appears to be somewhat of a smooth surface, but it's not like a licked surface type of smooth. When you look at it closer, you can see the handling of the paint. What I liked the most when looking at it was the puddle anf reflectioon between the stones- it's really amazing when you look at it in person.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "third">
            <h3>#3: Jacques-Louis David, The Death of Marat, 1793</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvrethree.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>I like basically any painting with a licked surface. This one's very interesting. She's laying on a wave in a relaxed posed, yet I can't imagine a way to comfortably lay in such a postion as she does. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fourth">
            <h3>#4: Anne-Louis Girodet, The Sleep of Endymion, 1793</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvrefour.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>This was one of the paintings I remembered from the Art History class I took my very first semester. I'm not sure why I was always drawn to it. Of course, the color pallette is very pleasing, and the hazy effect of the smoke makes it feel like you're experiencing the exact moment he painted. I was very excited when I realized I was at the station when I recognized the structure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fifth">
            <h3>#5: Théodore Géricault, The 1821 Derby at Epsom, 1821</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvrefive.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Doing some painting in high school and as a hobby, it makes me admire how well the effect o the sunlight and shadows are captured in this painting. I feel like I would be freaking out figuring out how to get such a natural, brushed-out effect Renoir creates.</p>
