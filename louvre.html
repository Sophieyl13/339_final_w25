            <p>The Louvre/Louvre Museum is on the right bank of the Seine. It's one of the most famous museums in the world, originally a defensive castle and converted into the primary of residence of the kings of France. First opening as a museum in 1793, the exhibition grew from 537 paintings to not approximately 500,000 objects. </p>

            <p>The Louvre was the first museum I visited during my trip. It was amazing from the objects to the architecture of the museum itself. I spent around a total of 8 hours at the museum that day, and every hour was worth it!</p>

        <div class = "favorites intro">
            <h2>My Favorites</h2>
            <p>Of course, it is not surprising that I didn't get to all the pieces in the Louvre, so here are my favorites of what I saw!</p>
        <!-- </div> -->
        <div class = "faves" id = "first">
            <h3>#1: Winged Victory of Samothrace, 2nd century BCE</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvreone.JPG" alt="Image of the statue Winged Victory of Samothrace">
            </div>
            <p>I don't know much about statues or how to analyze and understand them. However, when I saw this, I was amazed. I think the location and display had a lot to do with it. Entering from upstairs, you can immediately see it displayed in the middle standing powerfully.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "second">
            <h3>#2: Théodore Géricault, The Raft of the Medusa, 1818-1819</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvretwo.jpg" alt="A picture of the painting The Raft of the Medusa">
            </div>
            <p>Sometimes, seeing the painitng in-person changes my perception of it a lot, and this was one of them. I first learned about this painting in class my first semester. The composition was emphasized during lecture, and now I understand. The large scale of the painting adds to the senses when you view it from below. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "third">
            <h3>#3: Jacques-Louis David, The Death of Marat, 1793</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvrethree.jpg" alt="A picture of David's painting The Death of Marat">
            </div>
            <p>I love a realistic portrait with a smooth application of paint, and this hit the right spot in my brain. It was great looking at the details of shadowing and even the form of the body up close. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fourth">
            <h3>#4: Anne-Louis Girodet, The Sleep of Endymion, 1793</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvrefour.jpg" alt="A picture of the painting The Sleep of Endymion">
            </div>
            <p>I really like the light in this painting. The picture doesn't do it justice. I don't know if I'm remembering it wrong, but I feel like it seemed as if he was really glowing. The mist/smoke around his body makes it feel more mystical.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fifth">
            <h3>#5: Théodore Géricault, The 1821 Derby at Epsom, 1821</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvrefive.jpg" alt="A picture of the painting The 1821 Derby at Epsom">
            </div>
            <p>I like the lighting in this, but I think the main reason I like this is because I found the depiction of the horses funny. That's definitely not how horses run- they kind of look like they're flying.</p>
