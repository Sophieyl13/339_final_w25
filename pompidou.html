            <p>The Centre Pompidou houses the Musee National d'Art Moderne, which is the largest museum for modern art in Europe. It also houses the BPI(Bibliotheque publique d'information, Public Information Library in English) and IRCAM, a center for music and acoustic research. </p>

            <p>Visiting the Centre Pompidou was a nice was to spend Christmas! I will admit I was a little biased going in, as I am not a big fan of modern art. I guess I did not like the objects on display, because I can only find around 10 pictures of pieces in the museum. I did get a cute glass polar bear candle holder, though!</p>

            <h2>My Favorites</h2>
            <p>Below is my very limited list of favorites from the Centre Pompidou. </p>
        <!-- </div> -->
        <div class = "faves" id = "first">
            <h3>#1: Salvador Dalí, Guillaume Tell, 1930</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/pompidouone.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Surprisingly, this was my favorite. I definitely think seeing the paintings up close in real life changed my perception of them. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "second">
            <h3>#2: Max Ernst, A tissue of lies, 1959</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/pompidoutwo.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Similar to the first painting, seeing this painting up close made me admire it more. The painting appears to be somewhat of a smooth surface, but it's not like a licked surface type of smooth. When you look at it closer, you can see the handling of the paint. What I liked the most when looking at it was the puddle anf reflectioon between the stones- it's really amazing when you look at it in person.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "third">
            <h3>#3: André Derain, Two Barges, 1906</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/pompidouthree.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>I like basically any painting with a licked surface. This one's very interesting. She's laying on a wave in a relaxed posed, yet I can't imagine a way to comfortably lay in such a postion as she does. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fourth">
            <h3>#4: Paul Cézanne, Still Life with Apples and Oranges, c. 1899</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/pompidoufour.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>This was one of the paintings I remembered from the Art History class I took my very first semester. I'm not sure why I was always drawn to it. Of course, the color pallette is very pleasing, and the hazy effect of the smoke makes it feel like you're experiencing the exact moment he painted. I was very excited when I realized I was at the station when I recognized the structure.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- <div class = "faves" id = "fifth">
            <h3>#5: Auguste Renoir, Bal du moulin de la Galette, 1876</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvrefive.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Doing some painting in high school and as a hobby, it makes me admire how well the effect o the sunlight and shadows are captured in this painting. I feel like I would be freaking out figuring out how to get such a natural, brushed-out effect Renoir creates.</p>
