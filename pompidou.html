            <p>The Centre Pompidou houses the Musée National d'Art Moderne, which is the largest museum for modern art in Europe. It also houses the BPI (Bibliotheque publique d'information, Public Information Library in English) and IRCAM, a center for music and acoustic research. </p>

            <p>Visiting the Centre Pompidou was a nice was to spend Christmas! I will admit I was a little biased going in, as I am not a big fan of modern art. I guess I did not like the objects on display, because I can only find around 10 pictures of pieces in the museum. I did get a cute glass polar bear candle holder, though!</p>

            <h2>My Favorites</h2>
            <p>Below are the pieces I enjoyed seeing at the Centre Pompidou! </p>
        <!-- </div> -->
        <div class = "faves" id = "first">
            <h3>#1: Salvador Dalí, Guillaume Tell, 1930</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/pompidouone.jpg" alt="Guillaume Tell by Dalí">
            </div>
            <p>Like Cubism, I don't understand or know much about Surrealism. However, I have grown an appreciation for is especially because I don't think I could create a painting like that.  </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "second">
            <h3>#2: Max Ernst, A tissue of lies, 1959</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/pompidoutwo.jpg" alt="A tissue of lies by Max Ernst">
            </div>
            <p>I'm not sure what attracted me to this painitng so much. It might've been my love for a good complmentary color combo. Also, as I looked at it longer, the more shapes and faces popped out at me, which was a very interesting experience and definitely had me staring at it for longer than I thought I would.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "third">
            <h3>#3: André Derain, Two Barges, 1906</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/pompidouthree.jpg" alt="Two Barges by Derain">
            </div>
            <p>It was very interesting to see how the application of the beige-grey color in the water gave the effect of the rippling surface. The vibrant colors also went well together. It's funny looking at the rowers- some of them look very flat and laying in an uncomfortable position.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fourth">
            <h3>#4: Paul Cézanne, Still Life with Apples and Oranges, c. 1899</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/pompidoufour.jpg" alt="Cézanne's Still Life with Apples and Oranges">
            </div>
            <p>It was nice to see a Cézanne still life after learning about them. I got to see the effect of the fruits looking like painted cement balls in person (and the prespective that looks like the fruit and dishes/vase should be rolling off the chair by now). I like that he incorporates colors from the objects into the shading of the white cloth. </p>
