            <p>The Petit Palais was originally built for the 1900 Exposition Universelle and not houses the City of Paris Museum of Fine Arts. It is located across the street from the Grand Palais. The focal point of the facade of the Petit Palais is the central entrance. </p>

            <p>It's a little embarassing to admit I did not know about this museum until my dad dragged us there. We visited after going to the Musée l'Orangerie, since we had time. Because we arrived later in the day, we didn't get to visit every part before they closed. It was a very interesting collection of pieces. There were some that I recognized and some intersting unique pieces.</p>

            <h2>My Favorites</h2>
            <p>Because of the mix pieces from different periods and genres, some of my favorites are more funny-favorites. </p>
        <!-- </div> -->
        <div class = "faves" id = "first">
            <h3>#1: Claude Monet, Sunset on the Seine at Lavacourt, Winter Effect, 1880</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/palaisone.JPG" alt="Monet's Sunset on the Seine at Lavacourt, Winter Effect">
            </div>
            <p>I liked this painting partially because it reminded me of one of the paintings that began the Impressionist movement (Monet's Impression, Sunrise). I love looking at these painting up close in person, because it's amazing to see how a few strokes of yellow give them impression of a reflecting sunset on water from a distance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "second">
            <h3>#2: Camille Pissarro, Pont Royal and the Pavillon de Flore, 1903</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/palaistwo.JPG" alt="Pissarro's Pont Royal and the Pavillon de Flore">
            </div>
            <p>While I only learned more about Pissarro after my visit, it's interesting to look back at this image and instantly recognize it as his. It's not just because of the laying of the paint but also the way you have to look into the tree to see what's behind it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "third">
            <h3>#3: Octave Penguilly L'Haridon, Coast of Belleville, 1868</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/palaisthree.JPG" alt="Coast of Belleville by L'Haridon">
            </div>
            <p>I almost audibly gasped when I saw that this was a painting and not a photograph. If you haven't looked through my other reflections to know, I love when the painting looks as real and accurate as possible. I don't know why- it could be because of my perfectionism, but it's just a preference I have for some reason. it's truly amazing to see this and look at it up close and see basically no imperfection. It messes with my concept of time knowing this was painted during the Impressionism period (now I maybe understand why people were upset about Impressionism).</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fourth">
            <h3>#4: John William Waterhouse, The Rescue, 1909</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/palaisfour.JPG" alt="The Rescue by Waterhouse">
            </div>
            <p>I really like the overall harmony and lighting of the painting. The movement of the eyes when viewing it flows very smoothy as you're guided down from the woman to the man, and you follow his extended arm to the object in the water.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fifth">
            <h3>#5: D*FACE, Dog Save The Ǫueen, 2020</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/palaisfive.JPG" alt="Bust titled Dog Save The Ǫueen">
            </div>
            <p>This was more of a funny favorite. I didn't look too deep into the meaning and context behind it, but it was very interesting to look at, especially since there were several similar busts of other figures.</p>
