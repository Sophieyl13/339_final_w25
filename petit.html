            <p>The Petit Palais was originally built for the 1900 Exposition Universelle and not houses the City of Paris Museum of Fine Arts. It is located across the street from the Grand Palais. The focal point of the facade of the Petit Palais is the central entrance. </p>

            <p>It's a little embarassing to admit I did not know about this museum until my dad dragged us there. We visited after going to the Musee l'Orangerie, since we had time. Because we arrived later in the day, we didn't get to visit every part before they closed. It was a very interesting collection of pieces. There were some that I recognized and some intersting unique pieces.</p>

            <h2>My Favorites</h2>
            <p>Because of the mix pieces from different periods and genres, some of my favorites are more funny-favorites. </p>
        <!-- </div> -->
        <div class = "faves" id = "first">
            <h3>#1: Claude Monet, Sunset on the Seine at Lavacourt, Winter Effect, 1880</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/palaisone.JPG" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Surprisingly, this was my favorite. I definitely think seeing the paintings up close in real life changed my perception of them. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "second">
            <h3>#2: Camille Pissarro, Pont Royal and the Pavillon de Flore, 1903</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/palaistwo.JPG" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Similar to the first painting, seeing this painting up close made me admire it more. The painting appears to be somewhat of a smooth surface, but it's not like a licked surface type of smooth. When you look at it closer, you can see the handling of the paint. What I liked the most when looking at it was the puddle anf reflectioon between the stones- it's really amazing when you look at it in person.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "third">
            <h3>#3: Octave Penguilly L'Haridon, Coast of Belleville, 1868</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/palaisthree.JPG" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>I like basically any painting with a licked surface. This one's very interesting. She's laying on a wave in a relaxed posed, yet I can't imagine a way to comfortably lay in such a postion as she does. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fourth">
            <h3>#4: John William Waterhouse, The Rescue, 1909</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/palaisfour.JPG" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>This was one of the paintings I remembered from the Art History class I took my very first semester. I'm not sure why I was always drawn to it. Of course, the color pallette is very pleasing, and the hazy effect of the smoke makes it feel like you're experiencing the exact moment he painted. I was very excited when I realized I was at the station when I recognized the structure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fifth">
            <h3>#5: D*FACE, Dog Save The Çªueen, 2020</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/palaisfive.JPG" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Doing some painting in high school and as a hobby, it makes me admire how well the effect o the sunlight and shadows are captured in this painting. I feel like I would be freaking out figuring out how to get such a natural, brushed-out effect Renoir creates.</p>
