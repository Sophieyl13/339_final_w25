            <p>The Musee de l'Orangerie is an Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painting art galley. It's located in the west corner of the Tuileries Garden, next to the Place de la Concorde. It is recognized for the permanent display of Claude Monet's eight large "Water Lilies" murals. </p>

            <p>The Water Lilies murals were amazing. I actually did not do any research on the Musee de l'Orangerie, so I was surprised to see its collection in the lower level. There were many amazing collections, but I guess I was too focused on looking at the paintings that I didn't get many photos!</p>

            <h2>My Favorites</h2>
            <p>Of course. Water Lilies comes in first for my favorites at the Musee de l'Orangerie, but there were still other good pieces! </p>
        <!-- </div> -->
        <div class = "faves" id = "first">
            <h3>#1: Claude Monet, Water Lilies, 1920-1926</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orangerieone.JPG" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Surprisingly, this was my favorite. I definitely think seeing the paintings up close in real life changed my perception of them. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "second">
            <h3>#2: Claude Monet, Water Lilies, 1920-1926</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orangerietwo.JPG" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Similar to the first painting, seeing this painting up close made me admire it more. The painting appears to be somewhat of a smooth surface, but it's not like a licked surface type of smooth. When you look at it closer, you can see the handling of the paint. What I liked the most when looking at it was the puddle anf reflectioon between the stones- it's really amazing when you look at it in person.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "third">
            <h3>#3: Pablo Picasso, Seated Harlequin with Red Background, 1905</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orangeriethree.JPG" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>I like basically any painting with a licked surface. This one's very interesting. She's laying on a wave in a relaxed posed, yet I can't imagine a way to comfortably lay in such a postion as she does. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fourth">
            <h3>#4: Pablo Picasso, Nature morte sur un piano, 1911</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orangeriefour.JPG" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>This was one of the paintings I remembered from the Art History class I took my very first semester. I'm not sure why I was always drawn to it. Of course, the color pallette is very pleasing, and the hazy effect of the smoke makes it feel like you're experiencing the exact moment he painted. I was very excited when I realized I was at the station when I recognized the structure.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- <div class = "faves" id = "fifth">
            <h3>#5: Auguste Renoir, Bal du moulin de la Galette, 1876</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvrefive.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Doing some painting in high school and as a hobby, it makes me admire how well the effect o the sunlight and shadows are captured in this painting. I feel like I would be freaking out figuring out how to get such a natural, brushed-out effect Renoir creates.</p>
