            <p>The Musée de l'Orangerie is an Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painting art gallery. It's located in the west corner of the Tuileries Garden, next to the Place de la Concorde. It is recognized for the permanent display of Claude Monet's eight large "Water Lilies" murals. </p>

            <p>The Water Lilies murals were amazing. I actually did not do any research on the Musée de l'Orangerie, so I was surprised to see its collection in the lower level. There were many amazing collections, but I guess I was too focused on looking at the paintings that I didn't get many photos!</p>

            <h2>My Favorites</h2>
            <p>Of course, Water Lilies comes in first for my favorites at the Musée de l'Orangerie, but there were still other good pieces! </p>

        <div class = "faves" id = "first">
            <h3>#1: Claude Monet, Water Lilies, 1920-1926</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orangerieone.JPG" alt="An image of a panel of Water Lilies">
            </div>
            <p>I think this might've been one of the things I was most excited to see during the trip. I never thought I'd visit Paris, so I was very sad thinking I probably wouldn't be able to visit and experience being immersed in the panels. The immersive experience was already incredible. Viewing the individual panels up close and being able to position them with the other ones was amazing. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "second">
            <h3>#2: Claude Monet, Water Lilies, 1920-1926</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orangerietwo.JPG" alt="An image of a panel of Monet's Water Lilies">
            </div>
            <p>This specific part of the panel intrigued me because of its exposed canvas. I tried looking carefully at the other panels, and it seems like this part is the only one that has some of the canvas uncovered. I'm not sure about the specific reason behind why, but I think I remember learning about a painting of Monet's (possibly this one) that highlighted something about exposed canvas.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "third">
            <h3>#3: Pablo Picasso, Seated Harlequin with Red Background, 1905</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orangeriethree.JPG" alt="An image of the painting Seated Harlequin with Red Background">
            </div>
            <p>I like the intensitiy of the red in this painting. The figure seems to express some sad, negative attitude that's amplified with the greyish tone. I'd feel like blue may be a better correlated color, but somehow red really works. It's very bold and lets the figure stand out more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fourth">
            <h3>#4: Pablo Picasso, Nature Morte Sur un Piano, 1911</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orangeriefour.JPG" alt="A picture of Picasso's Nature morte sur un piano">
            </div>
            <p>I honestly haven't looked much into cubism, and I initally wasn't very enthusiastic about it because I preferred realistic paintings. However, I will admit, especially asfter doing some painting myself, that it is pretty impressive to have the ability to paint something like that without having a nervous breakdown about the placement and composition. It also does look like a painting if you look at it.</p>

        <!-- <div class = "faves" id = "fifth">
            <h3>#5: Auguste Renoir, Bal du moulin de la Galette, 1876</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/louvrefive.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Doing some painting in high school and as a hobby, it makes me admire how well the effect o the sunlight and shadows are captured in this painting. I feel like I would be freaking out figuring out how to get such a natural, brushed-out effect Renoir creates.</p>
