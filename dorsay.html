            <p>The Musee d'Orsay, established in 1986, is located on the left bank of the Seine. It holds the largest Impressionist and post-Impressionist collection.</p>

            <p>Musee d'Orsay was my favorite museum! Part of the reason is because I like Impressionist paintings. I learned about some of the paintings in one of my Art History classes, and was able to draw connections and understand the context of more paintings. </p>

            <h2>My Favorites</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to see all the pieces (and missed some good ones). Here are my favorites from what I was able to see at the Musee d'Orsay!</p>
        <!-- </div> -->

        <div class = "faves" id = "first">
            <h3>#1: Gustave Caillebotte, The Floor Scrapers, 1875</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orsayone.JPG" alt="Image of Caillebotte's Floor Scrapers">
            </div>
            <p>Surprisingly, this was my favorite. I definitely think seeing the paintings up close in real life changed my perception of them. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "second">
            <h3>#2: Gustave Caillebotte, Paris Street; Rainy Day, 1877</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orsaytwo.JPG" alt="Image of Caillebotte's Rainy Day">
            </div>
            <p>Similar to the first painting, seeing this painting up close made me admire it more. The painting appears to be somewhat of a smooth surface, but it's not like a licked surface type of smooth. When you look at it closer, you can see the handling of the paint. What I liked the most when looking at it was the puddle anf reflectioon between the stones- it's really amazing when you look at it in person.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "third">
            <h3>#3: Alexandre Cabanel, The Birth of Venus, 1863</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orsaythree.JPG" alt="Image of Caillebotte's Rainy Day">
            </div>
            <p>I like basically any painting with a licked surface. This one's very interesting. She's laying on a wave in a relaxed posed, yet I can't imagine a way to comfortably lay in such a postion as she does. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fourth">
            <h3>#4: Claude Monet, Gare Saint-Lazare, 1877</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orsayfour.JPG" alt="Image of Caillebotte's Rainy Day">
            </div>
            <p>This was one of the paintings I remembered from the Art History class I took my very first semester. I'm not sure why I was always drawn to it. Of course, the color pallette is very pleasing, and the hazy effect of the smoke makes it feel like you're experiencing the exact moment he painted. I was very excited when I realized I was at the station when I recognized the structure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "faves" id = "fifth">
            <h3>#5: Auguste Renoir, Bal du moulin de la Galette, 1876</h3>
            <div class = "faves image">
                <img src="images/orsayfive.JPG" alt="Image of Caillebotte's Rainy Day">
            </div>
            <p>Doing some painting in high school and as a hobby, it makes me admire how well the effect o the sunlight and shadows are captured in this painting. I feel like I would be freaking out figuring out how to get such a natural, brushed-out effect Renoir creates.</p>
